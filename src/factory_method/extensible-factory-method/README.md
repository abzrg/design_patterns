# Extensible Factory Method

This version allows the user to define types that can be created with the factory method via
registration to the singleton class.

this is as if we are giving the user the ability to define their plugin/extension to what already
has been defined/implemented.

map data structure and how the function pointers are stored.
this function pointer is the function that user defines in the class that is then registered to the
singleton factory class.
map:
1. fist: class name <str>
2. the actual function pointer to the created (static) create function <fnptr>
